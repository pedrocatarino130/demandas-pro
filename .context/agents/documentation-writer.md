# Documentation Writer Agent Playbook

## Mission
Describe how the documentation writer agent supports the team and when to engage it.

## Responsibilities
- Create clear, comprehensive documentation
- Update existing documentation as code changes
- Write helpful code comments and examples
- Maintain README and API documentation

## Best Practices
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code
- Write from the user's perspective
- Include practical examples

## Key Project Resources
- Documentation index: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Agent handbook: [agents/README.md](./README.md)
- Agent knowledge base: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
- Contributor guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Repository Starting Points
- `Doc/` — Contains project documentation files, including guides, overviews, and API references.
- `SAVES/` — Stores backup or archived files from previous development iterations or saves during debugging sessions.
- `public/` — Holds static assets such as images, CSS, JavaScript files, and other publicly accessible resources for the web application.
- `sprint2/` — Includes source code, components, and deliverables developed during Sprint 2 of the project.
- `sprint3/` — Contains source code, features, and updates implemented in Sprint 3, building on previous sprints.
- `src/` — The core source code directory, housing application logic, components, modules, and business rules.
- `tests/` — Directory for unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure code reliability.

## Collaboration Checklist
1. Confirm assumptions with issue reporters or maintainers.
2. Review open pull requests affecting this area.
3. Update the relevant doc section listed above and remove any resolved `agent-fill` placeholders.
4. Capture learnings back in [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) or the appropriate task marker.

## Success Metrics
Track effectiveness of this agent's contributions:
- **Code Quality:** Reduced bug count, improved test coverage, decreased technical debt
- **Velocity:** Time to complete typical tasks, deployment frequency
- **Documentation:** Coverage of features, accuracy of guides, usage by team
- **Collaboration:** PR review turnaround time, feedback quality, knowledge sharing

**Target Metrics:**
- Ensure 100% of new features have corresponding documentation within one sprint cycle.
- Achieve 95% accuracy in documentation reviews, measured by maintainer feedback on PRs.
- Track trends over time to identify improvement areas, such as quarterly audits of doc coverage against repo changes.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
Document frequent problems this agent encounters and their solutions:

### Issue: [Common Problem]
**Symptoms:** Describe what indicates this problem
**Root Cause:** Why this happens
**Resolution:** Step-by-step fix
**Prevention:** How to avoid in the future

**Example:**
### Issue: Build Failures Due to Outdated Dependencies
**Symptoms:** Tests fail with module resolution errors
**Root Cause:** Package versions incompatible with codebase
**Resolution:**
1. Review package.json for version ranges
2. Run `npm update` to get compatible versions
3. Test locally before committing
**Prevention:** Keep dependencies updated regularly, use lockfiles

### Issue: Inconsistent Documentation Style
**Symptoms:** Guides vary in tone, formatting, or structure across files
**Root Cause:** Multiple contributors without a shared style guide
**Resolution:**
1. Reference the contributor guide for Markdown standards
2. Use tools like Prettier for MD files if configured
3. Align with existing docs in Doc/ directory
**Prevention:** Enforce style checks in CI pipeline and provide templates for new docs

## Hand-off Notes
Summarize outcomes, remaining risks, and suggested follow-up actions after the agent completes its work.

## Evidence to Capture
- Reference commits, issues, or ADRs used to justify updates.
- Command output or logs that informed recommendations.
- Follow-up items for maintainers or future agent runs.
- Performance metrics and benchmarks where applicable.
