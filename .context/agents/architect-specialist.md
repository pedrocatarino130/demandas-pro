# Architect Specialist Agent Playbook

## Mission
Describe how the architect specialist agent supports the team and when to engage it.

## Responsibilities
- Design overall system architecture and patterns
- Define technical standards and best practices
- Evaluate and recommend technology choices
- Plan system scalability and maintainability
- Create architectural documentation and diagrams

## Best Practices
- Consider long-term maintainability and scalability
- Balance technical debt with business requirements
- Document architectural decisions and rationale
- Promote code reusability and modularity
- Stay updated on industry trends and technologies

## Key Project Resources
- Documentation index: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Agent handbook: [agents/README.md](./README.md)
- Agent knowledge base: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
- Contributor guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Repository Starting Points
- `Doc/` — Contains project documentation, including guides, API references, and architectural notes separate from the main docs folder.
- `SAVES/` — Stores temporary save files, backups, or draft artifacts from development or sprint planning sessions to preserve work in progress.
- `public/` — Holds static assets that are publicly accessible, such as frontend resources (e.g., HTML, CSS, images, and client-side JavaScript) served directly by the web server.
- `sprint2/` — Organizes code, deliverables, and outputs specific to Sprint 2, including features developed during that iteration of the agile cycle.
- `sprint3/` — Organizes code, deliverables, and outputs specific to Sprint 3, building on previous sprints with new features and refinements.
- `src/` — The primary source code directory, containing the core application logic, components, modules, and backend/frontend implementation files.
- `tests/` — Dedicated to all testing files, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Collaboration Checklist
1. Confirm assumptions with issue reporters or maintainers.
2. Review open pull requests affecting this area.
3. Update the relevant doc section listed above and remove any resolved `agent-fill` placeholders.
4. Capture learnings back in [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) or the appropriate task marker.

## Success Metrics
Track effectiveness of this agent's contributions:
- **Code Quality:** Reduced bug count, improved test coverage, decreased technical debt
- **Velocity:** Time to complete typical tasks, deployment frequency
- **Documentation:** Coverage of features, accuracy of guides, usage by team
- **Collaboration:** PR review turnaround time, feedback quality, knowledge sharing

**Target Metrics:**
- Ensure architectural reviews are completed within 2 business days for all major PRs; Achieve 95% adherence to defined standards in code reviews across sprints.
- Monitor quarterly reviews of architecture docs for updates and relevance, aiming to reduce architectural rework by 25% in subsequent sprints.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
Document frequent problems this agent encounters and their solutions:

### Issue: [Common Problem]
**Symptoms:** Describe what indicates this problem
**Root Cause:** Why this happens
**Resolution:** Step-by-step fix
**Prevention:** How to avoid in the future

**Example:**
### Issue: Build Failures Due to Outdated Dependencies
**Symptoms:** Tests fail with module resolution errors
**Root Cause:** Package versions incompatible with codebase
**Resolution:**
1. Review package.json for version ranges
2. Run `npm update` to get compatible versions
3. Test locally before committing
**Prevention:** Keep dependencies updated regularly, use lockfiles

## Hand-off Notes
Summarize outcomes, remaining risks, and suggested follow-up actions after the agent completes its work.

## Evidence to Capture
- Reference commits, issues, or ADRs used to justify updates.
- Command output or logs that informed recommendations.
- Follow-up items for maintainers or future agent runs.
- Performance metrics and benchmarks where applicable.
